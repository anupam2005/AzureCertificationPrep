**Access Control:**
**Azure AD B2B Tanent** - third part application development
Azure AD B2B allows you to invite partners to access your Azure AD-controlled resources by using their own existing identities. Partners invited to your Azure AD tenant will appear as a guest within your tenant and can have access and permissions configured as you would a normal user object in Azure AD.

**Azure AD B2C** is an identity access management platform built on top of Azure AD. Developers can create an Azure AD B2C tenant dedicated to their application(s). Application users can then bring their own identities (using supported social IDs), or simply have a local account just for the app. Developers who use Azure AD B2C to facilitate access to their application can rely on Microsoft for managing the infrastructure, scalability, and connectivity of an identity platform, instead of having to do so themselves.

Resoueces are inside Resource Group - Resources Group are in side Subscription - Subscriptions are inside managment group
We can use inbuilt roles in Azure or create custom roles.
For custom roles by default everything is denied & we can add/deny roles at our will.

Managed identities allow identities to be created within Azure AD for supported Azure resources. The Azure platform facilitates authentication against Azure AD for the given resource. Most importantly, this means that the resource does not have to have credentials stored locally.

Azure RBAC supports all of these scopes. Permissions also are inherited in this same order. For example, permissions allowed at the management group level provide access to all resources within all resource groups for a given management group subscription. Inheritance occurs at each level, down to the resource level.

Both Azure AD and Azure resource can control access through either built-in roles (provided by Microsoft) or custom roles (defined by the customer).

An Azure RBAC role defines the set of actions and data actions allowed (or denied) to be performed on Azure resources. These permissions are specific to Azure resource operations, and are entirely separate from Azure AD operations.

Azure AD Domain Services (Azure AD DS) is used to provide traditional Active Directory functionality such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos/NTLM authentication. This is provided through an Azure AD DS managed domain that is synchronized with Azure AD. This allows resources/applications/services in the cloud to access traditional Active Directory (AD) functionality without having to deploy AD Domain Services to VMs in the cloud. Note: Be mindful of the difference in wording between AD DS (traditional/on-premises) and Azure AD DS (cloud-based service).

Azure AD Connect provides various methods to synchronize identities between a traditional Active Directory forest and an Azure AD tenant. There are different methods for controlling where and how authentication occurs also (e.g., pass-through authentication, password hash sync, or ADFS). All of this is to help facilitate seamless single sign-on to Azure AD registered resources so that users do not have to remember two different sets of credentials.

Dynamic user groups rely on dynamic membership rules to control group membership. The platform manages membership by using these rules. The rules help to minimize administrative overhead by looking at user properties to determine whether a user should be a member of a specific group.

Dynamic user group membership can only include user objects. User group membership is based on a query that looks specifically at user properties (for example, Department, Company, Location).
