**Access Control:**
**Azure AD B2B Tanent** - third part application development
Azure AD B2B allows you to invite partners to access your Azure AD-controlled resources by using their own existing identities. Partners invited to your Azure AD tenant will appear as a guest within your tenant and can have access and permissions configured as you would a normal user object in Azure AD.

**Azure AD B2C** is an identity access management platform built on top of Azure AD. Developers can create an Azure AD B2C tenant dedicated to their application(s). Application users can then bring their own identities (using supported social IDs Facebook, Gmail), or simply have a local account just for the app. Developers who use Azure AD B2C to facilitate access to their application can rely on Microsoft for managing the infrastructure, scalability, and connectivity of an identity platform, instead of having to do so themselves.

Resoueces are inside Resource Group - Resources Group are in side Subscription - Subscriptions are inside managment group
We can use inbuilt roles in Azure or create custom roles.
For custom roles by default everything is denied & we can add/deny roles at our will.

Managed identities allow identities to be created within Azure AD for supported Azure resources. The Azure platform facilitates authentication against Azure AD for the given resource. Most importantly, this means that the resource does not have to have credentials stored locally.

Azure RBAC supports all of these scopes. Permissions also are inherited in this same order. For example, permissions allowed at the management group level provide access to all resources within all resource groups for a given management group subscription. Inheritance occurs at each level, down to the resource level.

Both Azure AD and Azure resource can control access through either built-in roles (provided by Microsoft) or custom roles (defined by the customer).

An Azure RBAC role defines the set of actions and data actions allowed (or denied) to be performed on Azure resources. These permissions are specific to Azure resource operations, and are entirely separate from Azure AD operations.

Azure AD Domain Services (Azure AD DS) is used to provide traditional Active Directory functionality such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos/NTLM authentication. This is provided through an Azure AD DS managed domain that is synchronized with Azure AD. This allows resources/applications/services in the cloud to access traditional Active Directory (AD) functionality without having to deploy AD Domain Services to VMs in the cloud. Note: Be mindful of the difference in wording between AD DS (traditional/on-premises) and Azure AD DS (cloud-based service).

Azure AD Connect provides various methods to synchronize identities between a traditional Active Directory forest and an Azure AD tenant. There are different methods for controlling where and how authentication occurs also (e.g., pass-through authentication, password hash sync, or ADFS). All of this is to help facilitate seamless single sign-on to Azure AD registered resources so that users do not have to remember two different sets of credentials.

Dynamic user groups rely on dynamic membership rules to control group membership. The platform manages membership by using these rules. The rules help to minimize administrative overhead by looking at user properties to determine whether a user should be a member of a specific group.

Dynamic user group membership can only include user objects. User group membership is based on a query that looks specifically at user properties (for example, Department, Company, Location).

For full access to Azure AD Identity Protection, Premium P2 licensing is required. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection

Multiple Conditional Access policies can be configured. All conditions of all policies that apply to a given access scenario must be met. As such, the What If tool helps in determining how multiple policies impact access to resources.

With the What If tool, you are able to enter in all of the various parameters for a given scenario, such as IP address, device type, risk level, etc. Using this information, the tool will then determine the impact of all applicable Conditional Access policies that have been configured (e.g., will access be allowed/denied, would MFA be required, etc.).

Azure AD Conditional Access meets this very need. It allows certain conditions to be met and enforced intelligently for different scenarios. Access can be blocked for specific scenarios or allowed under specific conditions, such as from specific devices, locations, risk levels, and much more.

An Identity Protection sign-in risk policy can be used to block sign-in attempts as they occur. This is based on risk levels associated with the authentication request itself. Risk levels can be calculated either in real time or offline (e.g., risky sign-ins based on anonymous IP addresses being used, sign-ins from geographically distant and atypical locations, malware-linked IP addresses, and more).

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) can be used to add more control over the usage of privileges. This applies to both Azure AD and Azure resource privileges. With PIM, privileges can be assigned, but not active. Additional features like just-in-time access to privileges, approvals, and justification can be configured.

Azure AD Identity Protection protects users and sign-ins from various risks, such as suspicious activity, leaked credentials, and much more.

A location can be configured globally within Azure AD Conditional Access. Locations are configured based on an IP address. They can also be tagged as a trusted location. Once a location is configured, it can be used in zero or more policies, either to include or exclude them.

Azure Active Directory Premium P1 is required to use Conditional Access.

Conditional Access does include functionality to create locations based on geography. This is similar in effect to a normal location that you can create. However, when using a geography, Microsoft manages the IP addresses associated with the location to determine whether a request originates from a specific country.

Automation is one of the key benefits of access reviews. It is possible to have the results of a review automatically applied to a resource once the review finishes (e.g., automatically removing users from security groups they are a member of if they don't respond to a self-review access review).

Access reviews can be scheduled to recur periodically, such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually. For example, a review could run on a monthly basis and be configured to allow a 2-week window within that month for the reviewers to participate.

User access to applications integrated with Azure AD for single sign-on can be reviewed through access reviews.
Azure AD and Azure resource roles defined within Privileged Identity Management (PIM) can be reviewed through access reviews.
Group memberships (including cloud-based, synchronized, and even Microsoft 365 groups) can be reviewed through access reviews.

Container groups allow a collection of containers to be scheduled on the same host. Containers in the container group share resources, local network, and storage volumes. This is like a pod in Kubernetes.

A VMSS can be deployed across multiple AZs within a single region. This helps to protect solutions from data center (availability zone) failure.

Azure Batch provides developers with an API, SDKs, and other management tools to help build applications where large-scale execution is required. These can be used to configure, manage, and monitor HPC jobs.

Azure Batch can be thought of as an HPC job scheduler as a service. Everything is managed and maintained for you by Microsoft. There is no job scheduler software to install/manage.

Azure CycleCloud is aimed at administrators and users of existing HPC solutions. CycleCloud supports common third-party HPC scheduler and file systems and helps automate and manage the deployment of an HPC cluster to Azure. This eases the transition to HPC in the cloud by allowing existing tools, processes, and understanding to be used with a cloud-based service.

Azure Container Instances does support persistent storage, and being a simple on-demand container execution environment, it is also charged on a per-second basis.

Azure Container Instances is designed for deploying a single pod of containers on demand, quickly. There is no support for full-fledged container orchestration.

The Premium plan provides VNet connectivity and other features such as pre-warmed workers and greater CPU/memory.

Azure App Service includes support for WebJobs. This functionality allows a program or script to be run by schedule or trigger. Such tasks are commonly run in the background as part of an overall application solution.

Deployment slots allow developers to deploy an app to a staging environment, perform validation and testing, and then easily swap the staging slot to production when ready. This feature requires a Standard App Service plan or higher.

App Service includes built-in authentication and authorization functionality (commonly referred to as Easy Auth). This supports sign-in providers such as Azure AD, Facebook, and Google.

An App Service Environment (ASE) can be used to deployed apps to to your virtual network and a hypervisor dedicated to you (when combined with Dedicated Host). An ASE is deployed to App Service plans on the Isolated tier.

Networking:

VNet peering leverages the Microsoft backbone to provide low-latency, high-bandwidth interconnectivity between resources on different VNets.

VNet peering does not provide transitive routing. For example, if you have two VNets peered to the same VNet (e.g., SPOKEVNET1 to HUBVNET1, and SPOKEVNET2 to HUBVNET1), this does not allow connectivity between SPOKEVNET1 and SPOKEVNET2 via HUBVNET1. This is possible when using routing, such as an NVA or when configured through Azure Virtual WAN, but it is not supported by default.

VNet peering helps to provide VNet-to-VNet connectivity so that resources on different VNets can communicate with one another without having to go over the public internet. That is to say that communication is allowed by private IP addresses.

NSGs are stateful. This means that when you create a rule, the response traffic is automatically allowed. This applies for both inbound and outbound rules. For example, if you create a rule that allows RDP traffic inbound, then you do not need to create a rule that allows the reply traffic back to the originating client.

App Service VNet integration requires a supported Standard, Premium, Premium v3, Premium v3, or Elastic Premium App Service pricing tier.

This is precisely what the VNet integration feature is used for. The emphasis is on outbound connectivity from the perspective of Azure App Service. For inbound connectivity to an Azure App Service app, you would require a feature such as Private Link.

ExpressRoute works through network providers that provide connectivity to Azure without using the public internet. On the other hand, VPNs work over the public internet.

ExpressRoute supports private peering (network-to-VNet connectivity) and Microsoft peering (network-to-Microsoft 365 connectivity). VPNs can only provide connectivity to an Azure VNet, not to Microsoft 365 services.

When a VNet is first created, there are several routes configured by default. This includes routes between subnets, as well as to the internet.

Service endpoints are configured at the subnet level to a specified resource provider (e.g., Microsoft.Storage). This then establishes a system route for the subnet to the given resource, which ensures traffic from resources in the given subnet will use the Microsoft backbone to reach the given resource type.

Access restrictions allow you to build a list of allow and deny rules that are evaluated in priority order. It's similar to the network security group (NSG) feature in Azure networking. You can use this feature in an Azure App Service Environment (ASE). Azure Documentation: Access restrictions.

NSGs provide the ability to control network access within a virtual network. You don't have access to the VMs used to host the App Service Environment itself. They're in a subscription that Microsoft manages. However, you can restrict access to the apps in your App Service Environment (ASE) by setting NSGs on the subnet. Azure Documentation: Network security groups.

Private Link allows more granular connectivity to be enabled than is possible with service endpoints. For example, with Private Link you can provide a private IP address to a specific storage account in your subscription, whereas with service endpoints, you are enabling a backbone route to all resources of a specific type (i.e., all Microsoft storage accounts that are accessed from the configured subnet).

Private Link allows the creation of a private endpoint. The private endpoint is effectively a network interface placed within your selected virtual network with a private IP address. This allows you to create a private IP address that can be used to access an Azure service (or customer-managed solution). Service endpoints do not create private IP addresses for services.
